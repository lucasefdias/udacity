# Project 5: Neighbourhood Map

This is the fifth project for [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)
This project uses [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) to create a single-page application that renders a map for the Theatre District in New York City (United States) with several venue markers and a sidebar that filters the displayed markers.
The map is rendered using the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial). Venues are provided by the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs).

1. Download the project directory (`neighbourhood-map/`), that contains the following:

  * `src/` (directory that contains the main JavaScript and CSS files for the app to function):
      * `components/` (directory for React components):
        * `ErrorBoundary.js` (wrapper that manages React component errors)
        * `Foursquare.js` (configures the Foursquare API for use inside the app)
        * `googleMapsConfig.js` (configures the Google Maps API for use inside the app)
        * `Map.js` (code for the Map component, which renders the map and its corresponding children - Markers, InfoWindows...)
        * `Navbar.js` (code for the Navbar fixed at the top of the app)
        * `SearchBar.js` (code for the SearchBar that filters venues by text)
        * `Sidebar.js` (code for the Sidebar that appears when the menu icon is clicked. It handles venue filtering.)
      * `App.css` (main css file for the app)
     * `App.js` (main JavaScript file. Contains the code for the App React component.)
     * `App.test.js` (test script for the App)
     * `index.css` (css for the `index.html` file)
     * `index.js` (js for the `index.html` file. Runs the React App)
     * `serviceWorker.js` (Service Worker for the App. Enables caching and offline use. Must be registered - `serviceWorker.register();` - inside `index.js`. Only available in production mode - after build)
  * `.gitignore` (contains all files that must be ignored when using git)
  * `package-lock.json` (file generated by `npm`. Corresponds to all dependencies installed to the project tree)
  * `package.json` (contains information on all dependencies and version of the app)

1. Make sure you have `Node.js` and `npm` installed following the versions described in the Dependencies section
1. Open the Terminal program and `cd` to the corresponding `neighbourhood-map folder`
1. Install all the dependencies described in the Dependencies section by running either in the Terminal:
    * ```npm install <package_name>``` for each dependency or
    * ```npm install``` to install all dependencies from `package.json`
1. Run ```npm run build``` to build the production app
1. To serve the app locally, make sure you run ```npm install -g serve```
1. Then, run ```serve -s build``` to serve the app
1. Open the provided address in your web browser (usually in the form of [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000))
1. Have fun!
