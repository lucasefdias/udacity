# Project 5: Neighbourhood Map

This is the fifth project for [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)
This project uses [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) to create a single-page application that renders a map for the Theatre District in New York City (United States) with several venue markers and a sidebar that filters the displayed markers.
The map is rendered using the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial). Venues are provided by the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs).
